          <p>An app that allows you to import a quiz, take the quiz and it will generate flashcards from your incorrect questions. As a Computer Science teacher, I often give my students quizzes or mini-tests to test their understanding. I often found that it was quite a monotonous task getting them to take note of their wrong answers. It also became apparent they would never learn from their wrong answers as they never looked at them again!

            So I decided that I would build an application where you create a custom quiz and it will create flashcards from any incorrect questions. This would solve the problem of students not being able to "store" their wrong answers and provides them with a more interactive way to learn from their mistakes.</p>

              <p>An app that generates a graphic of your favourite artists, albums and songs. I use Spotify everyday and love to find out what my most played songs or albums are. There are already apps that can do this but I want to create one that generates a graphic that you can share on social media with your favourite artists, albums and songs. I've always wanted to create an application that uses the Spotify API as well!</p>

            </a>
              <p>An app that allows couples to interact and play mini games with each other. The target audience is couples in long distance relationships.

                I am in a long distance relationship myself and recognise the struggles it can present, especially if one/both of the people involved have limited access to technology such as consoles/laptops etc. This app aims to solve that problem with the use of just your smartphone.
                
                It will involve being able to communicate in a unique way, play games with each other on a single app, send reminders to each other and be able to share a calendar together. These are just the preliminary features.</p>
